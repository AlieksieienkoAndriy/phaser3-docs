# Phaser 3 API Documentation

You can either:

1. Go to https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html to read the docs online.
2. Checkout this reposity and then read the documentation by pointing your browser to the local `docs/` folder.

You can also generate new docs locally by running `npm run gen` (and waiting a long time, it takes over an hour to build)
